#On the case of why im using Stero

Mono doesnt seem to give good spectrograms, so i think ill use Stero. Im not sure if this is the most correct thing to do
have done a little research but none of the papers That I have read refer to the use of Stero vs Mono, so ill stick
with Stereo For now. if this changes ill update the notes.


#On the case of how ill generate all the information Ill need

I got a good tip from Wium, about doing the computation on the computers in the lab. THis would work and I could split it
up, but to do that I need to be able to install python packages on the school computers, which I dont think I can do.So
I need to go talk to conan, this would be quicker than just doing it over the few days on my computer. Now I just need to
write a script to extract all the needed information. Which I think I do. I have it set up to generate spectrograms and
Text files filled with some information. Idk what that information is but it might be useful. Id rather print to much information
that not enough information that way I can pick out what i do and do not need. I also need to get songs, that will take a while
for me to split those up. but shouldnt be to bad




Should I cut the samples down into 30 seconds, That would speed things up


Marsyas is found in ~/Documents/marsyas
sample : ./bin/sfplay my_sound_file.wav



STEPS:
1. Sort .mp3 into Genre folders
2. Convert .mp3 into .wav and trim to 30 seconds
3. get rid of .mp3s
4. create .mf files for the genres
5. Figure out how to parse .arff files
